class UI():

    """
    Top level user interface for wind revenue gross generation.
    The user must load a met tower time series, a power curve file,
    and an electricity pricing file. These can be loaded in any order.

    The user may optionally set peak and off peak pricing hours. The
    default is 0-11 peak, 12-23 off peak.

    Once the input data are provided, the gross revenue can be caculated.
    The calculation is performed on a monthly and hourly basis.
    The data is saved in full precision to a pair of csv files,
    GrossRevenue-PeakHrs.csv and GrossRevenue-OffPeakHrs.csv
    and it is output to stdout in a pretty tabular format.

    The UI will start when windrevenue is first run. Sample data
    may be found in sample_data/*txt
